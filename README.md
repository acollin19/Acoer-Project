# Acoer-Project (Coderbyte)
Task is to create a to do list application that persists the data in a database of my choosing (SQLite3) using python and django. The features must include:
- Adding new entries
- Marking entries as completed
- Deleting entries
- Each entry should have the date it was added to the list

Assuming Django is already installed, to run the application in terminal:

$ git clone git@github.com:acollin19/Acoer-Project.git
$ pipenv shell
$ python manage.py runserver

Open development server http://127.0.0.1:8000/ by cmd+click to use the application.
